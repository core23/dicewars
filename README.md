Java DiceWars
=============

## Disclaimer

This is one of my first Java projects I did around 2010, so it's far away from modern coding standards.

I'd like to open source some of my work, because I like these games and it could inspire young java developer trainees.

## About the game

The game is quit similar to [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk), but the original idea came from a Flash game 
with the name DiceWars by GameDesign.

## Development

Start the game

```
$ mvn java:exec
```

Build the project and create a runable JAR

```
$ mvn package
```

## License

This bundle is under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
